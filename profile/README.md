## What is AltTab for Mac?  

**AltTab Mac** is a lightweight utility that brings the familiar Windows-style **Alt + Tab** app switching to macOS. While macOS already includes its own application switcher (via Command + Tab), many users coming from Windows find it less flexible. AltTab fills this gap by offering a visually rich, customizable window switcher that mimics the functionality Windows users are used to.  

With **AltTab for macOS**, you can:  
- Switch between applications and individual windows using **Alt + Tab**.  
- View live previews of all open windows in a grid layout.  
- Customize shortcuts, appearance, and window preview styles.  
- Manage multiple desktops and full-screen apps more efficiently.  
- Enjoy smoother multitasking on **MacBook, iMac, and Mac mini**.  

This tool is especially popular among users who recently switched from Windows and want a familiar workflow on their **MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or desktop Mac**. It works seamlessly on **macOS Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma**, and is fully compatible with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3).  

For power users, **AltTab macOS** also includes advanced settings to adjust animation speed, opacity, and even per-app rules, giving you complete control over how you interact with your workspace.
